"Analysis of U.S. Government Debt Trends and Projections (1997-2023)"

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of U.S. government debt trends using historical data from 1997 to 2023. It explores key questions regarding the yearly percentage increase in debt, monthly growth patterns, and projected future growth of publicly held debt. The analysis covers "Debt Held by the Public," "Intragovernmental Holdings," and "Total Public Debt Outstanding." Data was cleaned and analyzed using Excel, with methodologies including pivot tables and the FORECAST.ETS function for trend projection. The results indicate a steady increase in public debt over the years, with significant spikes during economic downturns and high-consumption periods.
